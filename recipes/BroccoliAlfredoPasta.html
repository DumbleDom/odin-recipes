        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>This broccoli Alfredo pasta is so pretty made with farfalle, 
            also called bow-tie pasta. Of course, you may use fettuccine 
            if you prefer.</p>
        <p>AS a main dish, this serves 2; as a side, it serves 4. Add a 
            salad, if you wish, and some bread. We love it as a side with 
            grilled chicken or shrimp.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>4 ounces farfalle pasta</li>

        </ul>

                Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook farfalle pasta at a boil,
                Stirring accasionally, until tander yet firm to the bite, about 12 minutes.

            <li>
                Add broccoli to a microwave-safe container along wiht 1/4 cup water. Cover and
                cook on High until bright green and tender with a bite, about 4 minutes. Drain;

                Meanwhile, melt butter in a skillet or saucepan over low heat. Stir in cream and 
                allow to simmer, stirring often, 3 to 4 minutes.
