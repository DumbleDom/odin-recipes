        <p>
            They're great comfort food for cold days! The cream of mushroom soup grave is great on both the pork chops and mashed potatoes.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1/2 yellow onion, sliced</li>
            <li>4 pork chops</li>
            <li>26 ounces condensed cream of mushroom soup</li>
            <li>1/4 cup water</li>
            <li>2 cubes beef bouillon</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Gather all ingredients. Preheat oven to 325 degrees F (165 degrees C).
            </li>
            <li>
                Place onion slices on the bottom of a glass baking dish. Lay pork chops over 
                onions. Cover chops evenly with condensed soup. 
            </li>
            <li>
                Add water and bouillon, breaking up the bouillon cubes to spread flavor. Cover
                the baking dish with aluminum foil.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake pork chops in the preheated oven, stirring gravy once or twice, until no
                longer pink in the centers, about 1 hour. An instant-read thermometer inserted 
                into the center of a chop should read at least 145 degrees F (63 degrees C).
            </li>
            
        </ol>
